          Growing up, there were few things I enjoyed more than my ride-on
          electric car. Mine was a four-wheeler-looking thing, similar to my
          number 1 below, that I used to traverse the small hill behind the
          house I grew up in. It had a plastic seat and wheels, and while no one
          would ever confuse it as an off-road vehicle, I honestly felt like I
          could conquer the world driving it around. These electric toys have
          gotten even more remarkable over the years. No longer is it just a
          generic 4-wheeler or generic jeep-looking toy; there are actual brands
          and models available. They’ve also improved safety by adding
          seatbelts, lower top speeds, and insulated battery areas. I may not
          remember every time I tipped over my old toy 4-wheeler, but I am sure
          my parents do. Growing up, I may not have had access to the latest and
          greatest electric toy cars, but kids nowadays do. So here is a
          shortlist of some of the more exciting toy cars available for your
          hill conquering kids at home. These electric toys have

          Rough, rugged, and fun to drive–the Power Wheels Ford F-150 Raptor Extreme is just like the real thing. It’s designed with oversized tires and a lifted body so that young drivers can power over the roughest backyard driving conditions, including wet grass, mud, and more. There’s a roomy truck bed with a working lift-and-lower tailgate, storage inside the dash, and a pretend radio with pre-loaded tunes, sound effects, and a voice-amplifying microphone. The Power Wheels F-150 Raptor seats two, drives two speeds forward (2.5 or 5 mph max) plus reverse, and is equipped with Power Lock brakes and a parent-controlled high-speed lockout for beginner drivers.
